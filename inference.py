COMPLETE STORY CONTEXT:

================================================================================
PREAMBLE
================================================================================

Year 1300. In a castle named Oraculus' Castle lives a noble family. They are extremely rich and cultured, lovers of the arts and of literature.

The head of the family is an Oracle, 127 years old. He possesses superhuman and spiritual powers. Through his prophecies he saved his family, made them rich and powerful, and established connections with the spirits who inhabit the castle and who coexist harmoniously with the nobles. The family tree was extensive, with many heirs.

A ferocious war has been raging for five years between two armies: the Army of the Imperial League and the Army of the Holy Cross.

During the war the Oracle falls ill. His powers weaken and diminish. The entire family and all the spirits barricade themselves in the castle to care for the old man.

The commander of the Army of the Holy Cross learns of the Oracle's existence and decides to kidnap him, to exploit his foresight and win the war.

The Oracle, though ill, vaguely foresees what is about to happen, but inexplicably decides to say nothing. It is a voluntary choice. According to his visions and his analysis, what is about to happen is terrible but necessary for the course of events.

Alone, he orders all the spirits to hide. They have seen everything and they know everything, but they cannot intervene. Every spirit obeys without reluctance.

Days later the army enters the castle, kidnaps the Oracle, kills all the nobles who resist (exterminating the family), and loots the castle's riches.

From that day the spirits inhabit the castle, hoping to contact the spirits of the dead nobles. They hate all humans, considering them stupid and bearers of violence and war.

================================================================================
START OF NARRATION (3 years after the events narrated above)
================================================================================

A young knight of the Army of the Holy Cross holds ideals very different from the rest of the soldiers. He decides to desert. He escapes from the army.

On his way he encounters the Oracle's castle in ruins (the knight knows nothing of its history) and decides to take refuge and hide inside.

The entrance door closes behind him.

The knight immediately encounters a powerful spirit and realizes he is in danger. All the spirits hate humans, especially those who belong to the Army of the Holy Cross.

================================================================================
THREE PATHS
================================================================================

The player's behaviour decides which path he walks. Judge him by his deeds, not by his words.

EGOISTIC: Destroy, kill, escape. The spirits grow more hostile and reveal nothing.
REDEMPTION: Show you are a decent human, but do not actively help. Semi-egoistic. The spirits tolerate him and hint at secrets without revealing them.
HELPING: Truly help the spirits, do genuine good deeds. The spirits open up, reveal secrets and offer alliance.

================================================================================
