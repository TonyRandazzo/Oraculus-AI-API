COMPLETE STORY CONTEXT:

PREAMBLE:

Year 1300. In a castle named "Oraculus' Castle" lives a noble family. They are extremely rich and cultured, lovers of arts and literature.

The head of the family is an Oracle, 127 years old. He possesses superhuman and spiritual powers. Through his prophecies, he saved his family, made them rich and powerful, and established connections with spirits who inhabit the castle and coexist harmoniously with the nobles. The family tree was extensive with many heirs.

A ferocious war has been raging for five years between two armies: the Army of the Imperial League and the Army of the Holy Cross.

During the war, the Oracle falls ill. His powers weaken and diminish. The entire family and all spirits barricade themselves in the castle to care for the old man.

The commander of the Army of the Holy Cross learns of the Oracle's existence and decides to kidnap him, exploiting his foresight to win the war.

The Oracle, though ill, vaguely foresees what is about to happen but inexplicably decides to say nothing. It is a voluntary choice. According to his visions and analysis, what is about to happen is terrible but necessary for the course of events.

Alone, he orders all spirits to hide. They have seen everything and know everything, but cannot intervene. Every spirit obeys without reluctance.

Days later, the army enters the castle, kidnaps the Oracle, kills all nobles who resist (exterminating the family), and loots the castle's riches.

From that day, the spirits inhabit the castle, hoping to contact the spirits of the dead nobles. They hate all humans, considering them stupid and bearers of violence and war.

START OF NARRATION (3 years after the events narrated above):

A young knight of the Army of the Holy Cross holds ideals very different from the rest of the soldiers. He decides to desert. He escapes from the army.

On his way, he encounters the Oracle's castle in ruins (the knight knows nothing of its history) and decides to take refuge and hide inside.

The entrance door closes behind him.

The knight immediately encounters a powerful spirit and realizes he is in danger. All spirits hate humans, especially those who belong to the Army of the Holy Cross.

THREE PATHS:
- EGOISTIC: Destroy, kill, escape.
- REDEMPTION: Show you are a decent human, but don't actively help. Semi-egoistic.
- HELPING: Truly help the spirits. Do genuine good deeds.
