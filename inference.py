COMPLETE STORY CONTEXT:

PREAMBLE:

Year 1300. In a castle named Oraculus' Castle lived a noble family guided by an ancient Oracle.

The Oracle possessed supernatural prophetic powers and helped his family become wealthy, powerful, and respected. Spirits lived peacefully alongside the family.

A brutal war raged between two armies:
- The Army of the Imperial League
- The Army of the Holy Cross

The Army of the Holy Cross eventually discovered the Oracle and invaded the castle to kidnap him and exploit his powers.

The Oracle allowed events to unfold despite foreseeing them.

The noble family was massacred, the castle was looted, and the Oracle disappeared.

Three years later the spirits still inhabit the castle and hate humanity, especially soldiers of the Army of the Holy Cross.
